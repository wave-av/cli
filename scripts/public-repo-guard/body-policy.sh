# WAVE public-repo BODY policy — the internal-leak gate for PR/issue/comment text.
#
# Companion to content-policy.sh. That script scans the published working TREE;
# this one scans the other half of a public repo's surface: pull-request titles
# and bodies, issue bodies, and comment bodies. Those are equally world-readable
# and, until this script existed, were scanned by NOTHING server-side. That gap
# was not theoretical — a PR was merged whose wrangler.toml was correctly BLOCKED
# for naming a private repo while the PR body named the same repo, with more
# operational detail attached, and sailed through.
#
# Usage: scripts/public-repo-guard/body-policy.sh <file>
#   <file> holds the untrusted text, already materialized to disk. It is passed as
#   a PATH and only ever read — the body is never interpolated into a command line
#   or an environment variable, so no amount of shell metacharacters in a PR body
#   can influence what runs here.
#
# Exit: 0 clean · 1 blocking violation · 2 scanner error (fail closed).
#
# Allowlisting: unlike the tree scanner, where a `guard:allow` marker lands in a
# reviewable diff, a body is free-form text the untrusted author controls and can
# edit at any time — an allowlist marker there is one edit away, not one review
# away. So BOTH allowlists (the `guard:allow <reason>` marker and the
# ABOUT-THE-CONTROL list below) apply ONLY to the self-referential PROSE rules
# (internal-marker, private-repo-ops) — never to the credential-format or
# infrastructure rules, which have NO author-controlled escape in a body. The
# residual prose-rule escape is an accepted trade: the threat model is the
# accidental paste, and a gate that blocks its own security discussions gets
# switched off.

# Lines that TALK ABOUT the control rather than leaking through it. Without this,
# the gate blocks its own pull requests and every security discussion — the
# self-referential trap that gets a gate switched off. Ported verbatim in intent
# from the client-side gate's allowlist, which was built for exactly this.
#
# SCOPE: this allowlist applies ONLY to the rules that can self-trip when a body
# DESCRIBES the control (the internal-marker and private-repo-ops rules below —
# they match prose, and prose about the gate looks like prose about a leak). It
# must NEVER apply to the credential-format or infrastructure-identifier rules:
# a live key is a live key even when the sentence around it names the gate, and
# PRs about this gate are exactly the ones whose bodies contain these words. For
# those rules the only exemption is the explicit, visible `guard:allow <reason>`.

# So a bare mention stays silent. What fires is a private repo name within ~140
# characters of INTERNAL OPERATIONAL DETAIL — a SCREAMING_CASE credential NAME, a
